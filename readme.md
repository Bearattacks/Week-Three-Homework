# Week Three Homework
Time Spent: 6 hours 

(I had a crazy busy week)

# Tasks
Dragging the headline should reveal the menu ✓

If you're dragging down, releasing the headline should animate the headline to the down position ✓

If you're dragging up, releasing the headline should animate the headline to the up position ✓

If you're dragging the headline up past the top, the friction should increase (I think I've almost got it)

Optional: Fade in different headlines every few seconds

Optional: Dragging on the scrollable feed of headlines should change the scale of the feed
